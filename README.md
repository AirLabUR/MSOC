# A Multi-Stream Fusion Approach with One-Class Learning for Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection
---
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper, "A Multi-Stream Fusion Approach with One-Class Learning for Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection"

# Data Preparation
---
Need to create a new csv file for our train, validation, and test datasets by running **add_meta_data.ipynb**
Need to run **create_pairs.ipynb** and **voice_converion.py** to create voice conversion fake videos which is part of our test set.

# Run the training code 
---
Need to change DATA_ROOT and OUTPUT before running the **scripts/run.sh**

# Evaluation 
--- 
Need to change DATA_ROOT and OUTPUT before running the **scripts/eval.sh**
